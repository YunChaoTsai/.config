# .config
My preferred shell of choice, [fish][1] stores all configuration files, commonly known as “dotfiles”, in a folder called ".config". This is my .config folder.

## Features


## Acknowledgements
My dotfiles would nonexistent if weren’t for these people, whose ideas and code I have forked, copied, learned from, and modified:
- Zach Holman
- Justin Mayer
- Matt Gauger

I’ve tried to note in code wherever possible their dotfiles have influenced mine.
